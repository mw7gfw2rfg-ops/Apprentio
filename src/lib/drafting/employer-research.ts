  const prompt = `You are researching a real UK employer for a sixth-form student who is considering a degree apprenticeship there. Use web search to find genuine, current, verifiable information about this specific company:

"${employerName}"

Research and report on:
1. A brief summary of what the company actually does (1-2 sentences).
2. Their stated values or company culture, if publicly stated anywhere (careers page, About page, press coverage). Leave this blank if you can't find anything genuine.
3. 2-4 notable, specific, verifiable facts -- recent news, awards, scale, notable clients/projects, apprenticeship or graduate programme details, etc.

Rules:
- Only report information you actually found via web search in this conversation. Do not use prior knowledge, and never invent or guess at facts.
- If "${employerName}" is too generic or ambiguous to identify a real company, or your searches turn up nothing genuinely useful, say so and report found: false rather than guessing.
- Include at least one real source URL you retrieved, if found is true.
- Be efficient: 2-3 targeted searches is enough. Don't cross-verify every claim across multiple sources or keep searching once you have enough for a good answer.

When you are done researching, respond with ONLY a single JSON object and nothing else -- no markdown fences, no other text before or after it -- in exactly this shape:
